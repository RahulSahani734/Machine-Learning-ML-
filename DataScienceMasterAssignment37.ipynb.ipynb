    " ### Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and outliers. This leads to excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to new, unseen data.\n",

    "### Answer :\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the tradeoff between two sources of error that affect model performance:\n",

    "Bias: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause underfitting.\n",
    "Variance: Error due to excessive complexity in the learning algorithm. High variance can cause overfitting.\n",
    "Relationship Between Bias and Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Bias: The model makes strong assumptions about the data, leading to a simple model that might miss relevant patterns (underfitting).\n",
    "High Variance: The model is highly sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, leading to a model that captures noise as if it were a true pattern (overfitting).\n",
    "Impact on Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Bias: Model has high training and test error. It is too simple to capture the dataâ€™s complexity.\n",
    "High Variance: Model has low training error but high test error. It captures noise and does not generalize well.\n",
    "The goal is to find a balance where both bias and variance are minimized, achieving a model that generalizes well to new data."
