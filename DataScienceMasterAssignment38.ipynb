    "### Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "### Answer :\n",
    "The Filter method in feature selection is a preprocessing step where features are selected based on their intrinsic properties without involving any machine learning algorithms. This method evaluates the relevance of each feature using statistical techniques or heuristics and selects the top-ranked features according to some criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common techniques used in the Filter method include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Coefficient: Measures the linear relationship between each feature and the target variable.\n",
    "Chi-Square Test: Evaluates the independence between categorical features and the target variable.\n",
    "Mutual Information: Measures the amount of information gained about the target variable through the feature.\n",
    "ANOVA F-test: Compares the means of different groups and examines if the means are significantly different.\n",
    "The Filter method is simple, fast, and computationally efficient as it does not require building and evaluating multiple models."

    "### Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "### Answer :\n",
    "The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it involves the use of a predictive model to evaluate the importance of features. Instead of relying solely on statistical measures, the Wrapper method uses the model's performance to assess the quality of different subsets of features. This typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a subset of features.\n",
    "Train a model using the selected features.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).\n",
    "Use the evaluation results to determine which features to add, remove, or retain.\n",
    "Common search strategies used in the Wrapper method include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Selection: Start with no features and add one at a time based on improvement in model performance.\n",
    "Backward Elimination: Start with all features and remove one at a time based on the least impact on model performance.\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Iteratively build the model and eliminate the least important features.\n",
    "The Wrapper method is usually more computationally intensive than the Filter method but can lead to better performance as it is tailored to the specific predictive model used."

    "### Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "### Answer :\n",
    "Embedded feature selection methods incorporate feature selection directly into the model training process. These methods combine the benefits of both Filter and Wrapper methods by evaluating feature importance during the model fitting phase. Common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, driving some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, which can help in reducing multicollinearity but does not perform feature selection as aggressively as Lasso.\n",
    "Elastic Net: Combines L1 and L2 regularization, balancing between feature selection and multicollinearity reduction.\n",
    "Tree-based Methods: Decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines inherently perform feature selection by evaluating the importance of each feature in the splits."
